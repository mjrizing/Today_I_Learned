CEF Quick summary:

+ Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) provides the ability to switch packets through a device in a very quick and efficient way while also keeping the load on the routerâ€™s processor low. 
  CEF is made up of two different main components: the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) and the Adjacency Table. 
  These are automatically updated at the same time as the routing table.

The adjacency table is tasked with maintaining the layer 2 next-hop information for the FIB.
