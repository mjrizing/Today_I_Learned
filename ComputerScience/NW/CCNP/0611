SD-Access Quick summary

There are 5 basic device roles in the fabric overlay:
+ Control plane node: This node contains the settings, protocols, and mapping tables to provide the endpoint-to-location (EID-to-RLOC) mapping system for
the fabric overlay.
+ Fabric border node: This fabric device (for example, core layer device) connects external Layer 3 networks to the SDA fabric.
+ Fabric edge node: This fabric device (for example, access or distribution layer device) connects wired endpoints to the SDA fabric.
+ Fabric WLAN controller (WLC): This fabric device connects APs and wireless endpoints to the SDA fabric.
+ Intermediate nodes: These are intermediate routers or extended switches that do not provide any sort of SD-Access fabric role other than underlay services.


Three major building blocks that make up SDA: the control plane, the data plane and the policy plane.
+ Control-Plane based on LISP
+ Data-Plane based on VXLAN
+ Policy-Plane based on TrustSec


SD-WAN Quick Summary
The primary components for the Cisco SD-WAN solution consist of the vManage network management system (management plane), the vSmart controller (control plane), the vBond orchestrator (orchestration plane), and the vEdge router (data plane).
+ vManage – This centralized network management system provides a GUI interface to easily monitor, configure, and maintain all Cisco SD-WAN devices and links in the underlay and overlay network.
+ vSmart controller – This software-based component is responsible for the centralized control plane of the SD-WAN network. It establishes a secure connection to each vEdge router and distributes routes and policy information via the Overlay Management Protocol (OMP), acting as a route reflector. 
It also orchestrates the secure data plane connectivity between the vEdge routers by distributing crypto key information, allowing for a very scalable, IKE-less architecture.
+ vBond orchestrator – This software-based component performs the initial authentication of vEdge devices and orchestrates vSmart and vEdge connectivity. 
It also has an important role in enabling the communication of devices that sit behind Network Address Translation (NAT).
+ vEdge router – This device, available as either a hardware appliance or software-based router, sits at a physical site or in the cloud and provides secure data plane connectivity among the sites over one or more WAN transports. 
It is responsible for traffic forwarding, security, encryption, Quality of Service (QoS), routing protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and more.


Cisco SD-WAN uses Overlay Management Protocol (OMP) which manages the overlay network. 
OMP runs between the vSmart controllers and WAN Edge routers (and among vSmarts themselves) where control plane information, such as the routing, policy, and management information, is exchanged over a secure connection.

VPNs in SD-WAN
In the SD-WAN overlay, virtual private networks (VPNs) provide segmentation. Each VPN is equivalent to a VRF, which is isolated from one another and have their own forwarding tables. 
An interface or subinterface is explicitly configured under a single VPN and cannot be part of more than one VPN. 
Devices attached to an interface in one VPN cannot communicate with devices in another VPN unless policy is put in place to allow it. 
The VPN ranges from 0 to 65535, but several VPNs are reserved for internal use.

The Transport & Management VPNs
There are two implicitly configured VPNs in the WAN Edge devices and controllers: VPN 0 and VPN 512.
– VPN 0 is the transport VPN. It contains all the interfaces that connect to the WAN links. Secure DTLS/TLS connections to the controllers are initiated from this VPN.
Static or default routes or a dynamic routing protocol needs to be configured inside this VPN in order to get appropriate next-hop information so the control plane can be established and IPsec tunnel traffic can reach remote sites.
VPN 0 connects the WAN Edge to the WAN transport and creates control plane and data plane connections. 
The WAN Edge device can connect to multiple WAN transport(s) on different interfaces on the same VPN 0 transport segment. 
At least one interface needs to be configured to initially reach the SD-WAN controllers for onboarding.
– VPN 512 is the management VPN. It carries the out-of-band management traffic to and from the Cisco SD-WAN devices. This VPN is ignored by OMP and not carried across the overlay network.
